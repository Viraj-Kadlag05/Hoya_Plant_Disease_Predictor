# Hoya_Plant_Disease_Predictor

## Goal:
The main goal is to predict the status of the plant i.e whether it is healthy or diseased then which disease is it and to provide the remedies for it.

## Prerequisites:
1. Google Colab
2. Plant Disease Dataset
3. Python 
4. Javascript
5. CSS
6. Html

## Libraries:
1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib

## How the model works:


## Challenges:

The dataset was very large it contained neary 70,000 samples due to which the model was taking too much for training. So we decided to reduce the samples and we took 4000 samples.


## Achivements:

We have successfully completed the training for our with nearly 75% accuracy. We have also developed a web interface for our project.

## What's Next:

We will try to increase the accuracy and also try to improve the web interface.
